## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine ("host environment").

JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (eg. change content on a page directly from inside the browser). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.

Hosted language as it runs in different environments. Browsers. Server-side (node.js or deno).

### JavaScript Engines

Built into the Browser. It parses, compiles to machine code and executes it.

- V8 (Chrome)
- SpiderMonkey (Firefox)

### Dynamic, interpretted

It is not precompiles. Instead its parsed and compiled on the fly. Code is evaluated and executed at runtime. Code can change at runtime. Therefore you can assign a different type value to a variable once it has been defined and initially assigned a value of another type.

### Weakly Typed

Don't declare specific types to variables. Variable types are inferred via assignment.

You can use your own language on the server... but... **There are still no alternatives to JavaScript in the browser.**

## ECMAScript

ECMAScript = JScript, ActionScript... and most importantly, JavaScript.
